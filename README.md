# miniature_sl_sign

The software side of a project to create a realistic SL-sign showing metro departures in Stockholm - but miniature.
The code is designed to work for a raspberry pi pico with an LCD 16x2 display.
Written in micropython for it to run on a micro controller.
The real time departures are fetched from trafiklab's open API.

Use Thonny to load the microcontroller with the files, additional helpful files are provided under */useful_files* for when things go wrong.
